\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
The purpose of this project report is to demonstrate the procedure followed to simulate Fan-Beam Projected X-Ray Computerized Tomography. This project report consists of \nameref{sec:theory}, \nameref{sec:implementation}, \nameref{sec:results} and \nameref{sec:discuss} sections. The second section introduces the technical background for the CT simulation and the following section illustrates the algorithm using pseudocode snippets. \nameref{sec:results} and \nameref{sec:discuss} section presents the comparative results regarding different user-specified parameters with the conclusion and reasons behind them.

\subsection{History}
The history of X-Ray Computerized Tomography can be dated back to 1917, when an Austrian mathematician called Johann Radon invented an algorithm, referred to as Radon transform today, on how to calculate line integrals in a two-dimensional section. The idea of computed tomography was developed in 1967 and was first used in a medical setting was in 1971 \cite{richmond2004sir}, by Godfrey Hounsfield. The device was tested at
James Ambroseâ€™s department at Atkinson Morley Hospital in Wimbledon. This first model did not include a computer, instead the waves was written on a magnetic tape of the device EMI Scanner CT1010 in Figure \ref{fig:CT1010}. It was in 1973 that commercial CT scanners were available to the public. \cite{CTHist}

\section{Theory} \label{sec:theory}
\subsection{X-Ray Attenuation}
In X-ray tomography, images are modelled as attenuation coefficient distributions which is a measure of how much X-ray beams are attenuated when they propagate through an object. This problem can be modeled as in Eqn. \ref{eq:radon3d} for an arbitrary object.
\begin{equation} 
	I_{measured} = I_0 e^{-\iiint\limits_{object}\mu(x,y,z)dxdydz}
	\label{eq:radon3d}
\end{equation}
When the object to be imaged is two-dimensional or can be reduced to a two-dimensional slice, Eqn \ref{eq:radon3d} reduces to Eqn \ref{eq:radon2d}:
\begin{equation}
	I_{measured} = I_0 e^{-\iint\limits_{slice}\mu(x,y)dxdy}
	\label{eq:radon2d}
\end{equation}
\subsection{Radon Transform}
Radon Transform computes the line integrals along the objects to obtain projections along an arbitrary angle $\theta$ for an arbitrary beam t, using the formula given in Eqn. \ref{eq:radongeneral}.
\begin{equation}
	p_{\theta}(t) = \iint\limits_{-\infty}^{\ \ \ \infty}\mu(x,y)\delta(xcos(\theta)+ysin(\theta)-t)dxdy
	\label{eq:radongeneral}
\end{equation}
This equation models the X-ray beams as parallel lines through the object. In a more practical scenario, the X-ray source is modelled as a point source and beams are projected from source to the object in fan beam shape, due to the equiangular spaced discrete detector locations. This modelling can be achieved by introducing geometric transformation between projection variables. 

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{images/PvsB.jpg}
\caption{Parallel Beams and Fan Beams \cite{zeng2017image}}\label{fig:PvsB}
\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:PvsB}b, the projection angle with respect to center of rotation is defined as $\beta$ and the deviation from the center beam that is parallel to the $\beta$ beam is defined as $\gamma$ angles. In addition, the source to origin distance is labelled as $D$, resulting in source to detector distance of $2D$. 

With source to detector distance redefined as D and the remaining quantities defined as above, one could transform the equation in \ref{eq:radongeneral} to \ref{eq:transformedgeneral} using Eqn. \ref{eq:trans1} and \ref{eq:trans2}.
\begin{align}
	t &= D \cdot sin(\gamma) \label{eq:trans1} \\
	\theta &= \beta + \gamma \label{eq:trans2} \\
	p_{\beta}(\gamma) &= \iint\limits_{-\infty}^{\ \ \ \infty}\mu(x,y)\delta(xcos(\theta)+ysin(\theta) \label{eq:transformedgeneral} \\&-Dsin(\gamma))d\gamma d\beta \nonumber 
\end{align}

\subsection{Fourier Slice Theorem}

The Fourier slice theorem states that Fourier transform of a projection vector $S_{\theta}(\omega) = \mathcal{F}(p_{\theta}(t))$ is the section of the original image distribution's Fourier transform $\mathcal{F}(\omega,\theta)$ along the slice of angle $\theta$, which is formally described by Eqn. \ref{eq:Fslice} \cite{kak2001principles}.

\begin{equation}
	S_{\theta}(w) = \cal{F}(\omega\cos\theta,\omega\sin\theta)
	\label{eq:Fslice}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Back Projection}

According to Fourier Slice theorem, as it is formulated in \cite{kak2001principles}, the original image distribution from projections can be obtained as follows:

\begin{equation}
	f(x,y) = \int\limits_0^\pi\left[\int\limits_{-\infty}^{+\infty}S_{\theta}(\omega)|w|e^{-j2\pi{\omega}t}d\omega\right]d\theta
	\label{eq:perfectreconstruction}
\end{equation}

The term $|w|$ originates from the Jacobian of the coordinate transformation between Cartesian Space and Polar frequency variables. 

\begin{align}
	f(x,y) &= \int\limits_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\int\limits_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\mathcal{F}(u,v)e^{-j2\pi{(ux+vy)}}du{dv} \label{eq:2DFFT} \\
	u &= \omega\cos\theta \\
	v &= \omega\sin\theta \\
	du dv &= \omega d\omega d\theta \label{eq:Jacobian}
\end{align}

The factor $\omega$ in Eqn. \ref{eq:Jacobian} derives from the Jacobian as follows:
\begin{gather}
	\begin{align}
	J &= \begin{vmatrix}
		\frac{\partial u}{\partial \omega} & \frac{\partial v}{\partial \omega} \\ 
		\frac{\partial u}{\partial \theta} & \frac{\partial v}{\partial \theta} 
	\end{vmatrix} = \begin{vmatrix}
		\cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ 
		-\omega\sin\theta & \omega\cos\theta \\
	\end{vmatrix} \\
	&= \omega(\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta) = \omega
	\end{align}
\end{gather}

\subsection{Convolution Back Projection} \label{subsec:convback}
Eqn. \ref{eq:perfectreconstruction} tells us that the 1D Fourier transforms of the projection vectors should be weighted, \textit{i.e.} filtered, with $|w|$ to obtain the perfect reconstruction of the original unknown distribution. From Eqn. \ref{eq:perfectreconstruction}, one can deduce that the impulse response of the projection system is $\frac{1}{|\omega|}$, \textit{i.e.}, the components representing the high frequencies in the image distribution is attenuated when they are projected and represented in the Fourier space. 
\vfill{\null}
To overcome this low-pass effect, the projections should be filtered with the sequence having the frequency distribution $|w|$. The filter having the band-limited characteristics of above-mentioned frequency response is called Ram-Lak filter.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.8\columnwidth]{images/ramlak.png}
	\caption{Ram-Lak filter response}\label{fig:barthannresp}
	\end{figure}

The sharp decrease in the Ram-Lak filter response causes ringing effect in the reconstructed images. To overcome this, the filter can be smoothed out in the higher frequency region with low-pass windows given in Figure \ref{fig:smoothingfilters}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\columnwidth}
		\centering
	  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/hamm.png}
	  \caption{Hamming window}

	  \label{fig:bart}
	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Smoothing window functions}
	\label{fig:smoothingfilters}
\end{figure}

Then, the resultant filter responses are as follows:

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\columnwidth}
		\centering
	  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/smoothedhamm.png}
	  \caption{Hamming \newline smoothed Ram-Lak}

	  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/smoothedhann.png}
	  \caption{Bart-Hann \newline smoothed Ram-Lak}
	  \label{fig:smoothbarthann}
	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Ram-Lak filter response smoothed out with window functions}
	\label{fig:smoothedfilters}
\end{figure}

The columns of the projection matrix of size $[\#Rays \times \#Projection Angles]$ is convolved with the filters having the responses shown in Figure \ref{fig:smoothedfilters}. This operation is called Convolution Back Projection.

\section{Implementation} \label{sec:implementation}

In this section, the computer implementation of the scientific background explained in Section \nameref{sec:theory} is going to be described.

\begin{algorithm}[h]

		  \EndFor
	   \EndFor
	   \State \textbf{return Projection matrix}
	\EndProcedure
	\end{algorithmic}
	\label{alg:projection}
\end{algorithm}

The matrix returned by the procedure defined in Algorithm \ref{alg:projection} is used in Algorithm \ref{alg:backprojection} to reconstruct the image.

	   \EndFor
	   \State \textbf{return Reconstructed Image}
	\EndProcedure
	\end{algorithmic}
	\label{alg:backprojection}
\end{algorithm}

The developed application implements the above algorithms in order to project and reconstruct the image. All components of the software and the Graphical User Interface is implemented in MATLAB(The MathWorks\textsuperscript{\textregistered}, Inc., Natick, Massachusetts, United States.)

In addition, the effect of the parameters such as filter type, projection angle step size and number of detectors are examined using the structural similarity index \cite{wang2004image} between the gray intensity pictures of ground truth phantoms and reconstructed images.

\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discuss}

A series of experiments are conducted to observe the effect of different imaging parameters in fan-beam X-ray computerized tomography setup. The results of the regarding experiments are shared in the \nameref{sec:results} Section. This section is devoted evaluate the results both quantitatively and qualitatively.
\subsection{Convolution Back Projection filter}

A series of filters and windows are used in convolution back projection implementation to overcome the low-pass effect of the back projection algorithm described in Section \ref{subsec:convback}. The reconstruction similarity metrics in Table \ref{tab:filter} show that the proposed filters can increase the similarity metric up to by 60\% with respect to the metrics obtained by plain back projection algorithm for 3 of the 4 phantoms. This relation was not observed in the \textbf{square} phantom. The reason can be attributed to the fact that ringing effects (pixelation) caused by the filters decreases structural similarity in the regions further from the main object, although they increase the contrast by their high frequency characteristics. 
\subsection{Number of Beams - Number of Detectors} \label{subsec:beams}

X-Ray CT systems are considered to be overdetermined linear systems, due to high number of equations introduced by each X-ray beam compared to the number of pixels to be reconstructed. Table \ref{tab:beams} shows that increasing the number of beams, hence increasing the number of measurements, may result in an increase of up to 105\% in the similarity index. The theoretical explanation is that reconstructions with less error is possible in the higher dimension of measurements.

\subsection{Projection Angle Step Size - Number of Fans}
The same relationship observed in the case of increasing number of beams is encountered in the case of increased number of fans. Table \ref{tab:angle} shows that more number of fans may increase the similarity index by 78\%. The reason behind this is that increasing the number of fans increases the number of measurement, as it is described Section \ref{subsec:beams}, 

\subsection{Qualitative Assessment}
In \Cref{fig:lenaprojected,fig:sqcircprojected,fig:squareprojected,fig:sheppprojected,fig:sqimproved,fig:sqcircimproved}, it is possible to observe an increasing contrast and quality of reconstructed images when convolution back projection algorithm is used. It is clear that introduction of these filters into the algorithm removes introduced by back projection.
